  <h1>Refund & Guarantee Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 17 October 2025</p>

  <h2>Our outcome guarantee</h2>
  <div class="card"><strong>“10 accepted quotes in 7 days or we keep working free until you do.”</strong> After go-live, if you send real quotes and keep your details accurate but do not reach 10 accepted quotes within 7 days, we’ll continue working at no additional cost until the threshold is met.</div>

  <h2>Change of mind</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Before kickoff:</strong> full refund of any deposit on request.</li>
    <li><strong>After kickoff but before go-live:</strong> pro-rata refund of the setup fee for work not yet performed (we’ll outline what’s been completed).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project not delivered</h2>
  <p>If we fail to deliver the agreed scope within a reasonable time after kickoff and you do not wish to continue, we will refund the setup fee you paid.</p>

  <h2>Payments & fees</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All prices are in AUD; GST applies if applicable.</li>
    <li>Third-party processing fees (e.g., Stripe) may be non-refundable according to the provider’s policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to request a refund</h2>
  <p>Email <a href="mailto:billing@tradeanchor.com.au">billing@tradeanchor.com.au</a> with your business name, contact email, invoice number, and the reason for your request. We aim to respond within 2 business days.</p>

  <h2>Exceptions</h2>
  <p>Refunds don’t apply where delays or outcomes are caused by missing access, inaccurate data, non-payment, or changes you request beyond the agreed scope.</p>

  <p class="small">This policy is in addition to your rights under Australian Consumer Law.</p>
