  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 17 October 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Who we are.</strong> “TradeAnchor” (product name <em>Flowio</em>) is operated by a sole trader in Australia (ABN: <strong>[YOUR ABN]</strong>). Contact: <a href="mailto:support@tradeanchor.com.au">support@tradeanchor.com.au</a>.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lead info</strong> from website forms: name, business, email, phone, trade, and UTM/source.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational data</strong> inside Google Workspace: quote details, client contact, totals, acceptance time, job date/time.</li>
    <li><strong>Telemetry</strong>: simple event logs (quote built, link viewed, accepted, SMS sent, payment status).</li>
    <li><strong>Payments</strong> via Stripe: we see payment status and amounts; we never see full card numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Plausible.io privacy-friendly stats (no cross-site tracking, no cookies by default).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why we collect it</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To deliver the product (build quotes, accept jobs, send SMS/email, create calendar events).</li>
    <li>To send transactional messages (booking confirmations, reminders).</li>
    <li>To improve the product and measure funnel performance.</li>
    <li>To comply with law and prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where data lives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Workspace</strong> (Sheets, Docs, Drive, Calendar) – your operational data stays in your Google account.</li>
    <li><strong>Stripe</strong> – payment processing and receipts.</li>
    <li><strong>ClickSend/MessageMedia</strong> – SMS delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Make.com</strong> – workflow automation between the above systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Plausible</strong> – anonymous website analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal basis</h2>
  <p>We process data with your consent (form submits), to perform a contract (delivering quotes/acceptance/notifications), and for legitimate interests (product analytics, preventing abuse).</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We share data only with the processors listed above and as required by law.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lead/contact data: until you ask us to delete it or it’s no longer needed for the purpose collected.</li>
    <li>Operational logs: typically 12–24 months for support/analytics.</li>
    <li>Invoices/financial records: per Australian record-keeping laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Opt out of marketing at any time (every non-transactional email includes an unsubscribe link).</li>
    <li>Request access, correction, or deletion: <a href="mailto:privacy@tradeanchor.com.au">privacy@tradeanchor.com.au</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use Google-native auth, HTTPS everywhere, limited access on a need-to-know basis, and event monitoring. No system is perfect; please report issues to <a href="mailto:security@tradeanchor.com.au">security@tradeanchor.com.au</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Our services are for businesses, not children under 16.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We’ll update this page when policies change and note the new effective date.</p>

  <p class="small">This summary is written in plain English. It does not limit your statutory rights under Australian law.</p>
