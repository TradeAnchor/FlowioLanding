  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 17 October 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Who we are.</strong> TradeAnchor (Flowio), sole trader in Australia (ABN: <strong>[YOUR ABN]</strong>). Contact: <a href="mailto:support@tradeanchor.com.au">support@tradeanchor.com.au</a>. These Terms govern our installation and use of Flowio for your business.</p>

  <h2>1) Deliverables</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google-native Quote → Accept → Job flow (Sheets, Docs, Drive, Calendar).</li>
    <li>Per-quote PDF/Doc output and accept page with secure link.</li>
    <li>Calendar event creation, SMS confirmations/reminders, optional Stripe Checkout for deposits.</li>
    <li>Error alerts to your nominated email and a simple owner dashboard/summary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Fees & payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Setup fee:</strong> AUD $3,000 one-time (early pilots may be discounted by agreement).</li>
    <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> 50% deposit at kickoff; 50% at go-live (Stripe). Prices in AUD; GST applied if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Care plan (optional after 12 months):</strong> $149/mo or $180/hr per incident (quoted/approved beforehand).</li>
    <li>Third-party usage fees (e.g., SMS, Stripe) are billed by those providers or passed through at cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Guarantee</h2>
  <div class="card"><strong>“10 accepted quotes in 7 days or we keep working free until you do.”</strong> You agree to send real quotes during the period and keep your contact details/templates accurate. We will extend the period and continue work at no extra cost until the threshold is met.</div>

  <h2>4) Your responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate business info (ABN, logo, email domain), Sheet access, and calendar details.</li>
    <li>Maintain your Google Workspace, Stripe, and SMS accounts in good standing.</li>
    <li>Use Flowio lawfully and respect customer privacy, opt-outs, and fair use of SMS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data ownership & IP</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your data:</strong> Your quotes, documents, jobs, and calendars in Google remain yours.</li>
    <li><strong>Our IP:</strong> Implementation scripts, templates, and know-how remain ours. We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use them within your Workspace.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We rely on providers like Google, Stripe, ClickSend, and Make.com. Their outages/changes can impact Flowio. We will provide break-fix support (see Section 8) but are not responsible for third-party platform failures.</p>

  <h2>7) Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Each party must keep the other’s non-public information confidential, except where disclosure is required by law.</p>

  <h2>8) Support & changes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Included for 12 months:</strong> break-fix support for regressions (things that used to work and broke), minor template tweaks, auth/token fixes, and compatibility updates due to platform changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Out of scope:</strong> new features, complex integrations, or significant customisations—quoted separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law: (a) we exclude indirect or consequential loss; and (b) our total liability arising out of or in connection with the services is capped at the amounts you paid in the 12 months before the claim.</p>

  <h2>10) Termination</h2>
  <p>Either party may terminate for material breach not cured within 14 days of notice. On termination, your Google data remains in your account; your licence to our implementation materials ends.</p>

  <h2>11) Governing law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>[STATE/TERRITORY], Australia</strong>. Courts in that jurisdiction have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
